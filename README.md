# SCRIPT NAME: cloud_automation.sh

This script makes it possible to run one or more commands for several clouds at the same time. Just include a list of clouds in a text file, one below the other. There is no need to include a comma.
For the scipt to get the text file, change the value of the variable FILE to the name of the .txt file.

Note: Place the text file inside the same folder as the script.
